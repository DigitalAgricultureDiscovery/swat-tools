To finish processing your LUU Uncertainty data perform 
the following steps:

1) In your extracted output folder (where this README file 
is located), navigate to the folder called 'dist'.

2) Inside the 'dist' folder, double click the file named 
process_realizations.exe. Agree to any permission requests 
that might appear.

Warning) If your 'dist' folder has been moved outside of
the original extracted output folder, a pop-up dialog will 
appear asking you to select the folder containing your 
LUU Uncertainty output - specifically the folder with 
your realization .dat files. This pop-up dialog will only 
appear if you relocate your 'dist' folder.

3) You will be prompted to navigate to your SWAT Project 
folder and select your SWAT executable located in the 
Scenarios/Default/TxtInOut folder. Make sure this is the 
the same SWAT project folder you uploaded to the LUU 
Uncertainty website.

4) After selecting the SWAT executable no more steps will 
be required from you. Once the tool has finished, you will 
have a new folder for each realization in your extracted 
output folder. Inside these folders are the output files 
created by processing the realization.
